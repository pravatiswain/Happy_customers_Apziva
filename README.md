# Happy_customers_Apziva

In this project, the goal is to predict if the customer is happy based on their feedback to improve the service quality. This dataset is from a startup in the logistics and delivery domain. 
- First, I did EDA to understand and visualize the effect of other features on the target variable. I used supervised machine learning classification algorithms to predict if a customer is happy or not based on their feedback. 
- I used the Lazypredict library to build different models before parameter tuning and understand which model works better. To improve the model performance, I used Recursive Feature elimination for feature selection and Stacking Ensemble. 
- I also implemented HyperOpt parameter tuning and TPOT classifier in this dataset.
